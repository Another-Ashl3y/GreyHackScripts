Ellipse was conceived to mainly be used in the corporate 
sphere, and its strengths were security and portability since 
it was possible to install the system in different 
architectures with few changes to the code. To achieve this, 
the whole system was rewritten in a programming language called 
Greyscript along with its own closed source compiler. Its 
peculiar implementation made it really difficult to infect or 
exploit, in part because nobody managed to create a reliable 
decompiler for Greyscript. 

In a cryptic message released on the web in 1996, the company 
announced that Ellipse where to be made available for both 
personal and commercial use completely free without any 
licensing. The secrecy surrounding Neurobox along with several 
cryptic messages published by the company, has spawned numerous 
theories about the company’s origin and agenda while also 
boosting the popularity of the operating system.
