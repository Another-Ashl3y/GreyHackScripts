In 1998 the first major vulnerability in Ellipse was 
discovered, this vulnerability had been exploited for months 
until it was discovered, which led to harsh criticism of the 
company. Their response was the last public message by the 
company to date: 

“Everything under control”

Less than 24 hours later a patch was released that fixed the 
vulnerability. Since then, new vulnerabilities keep appearing, 
several of which have been connected to corporate espionage and 
bank heists among other things. To this day the company is 
stuck in a perpetual cycle of finding and patching these never-
ending flaws.

One popular theory is that Neurobox themselves are behind the 
security flaws, but what they would have to gain from doing 
this and why they continue to patch their system if that were 
the case, remains unclear. Meanwhile, the many years of silence 
from Neurobox since the hacking surge began, continue to 
inspire new conspiracy theories about the company.
