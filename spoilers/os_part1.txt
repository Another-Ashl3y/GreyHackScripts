In 1972, the UNIX operating system was rewritten in the 
programming language C, opening the possibility for other 
programmers to create their own operating system variants. 

During the following years different companies bought licenses in 
order to distribute their own versions of the operating system. 
Despite the great popularity of Linux after its creation in 1992, 
and despite it being open source, it was eventually surpassed by a 
similar operating system with certain peculiarities.

In 1994 the company Neurobox published its closed source operating 
system called Ellipse along with an SDK. To date, the names of the 
programmers behind the project have not been made public. Although 
the system was initially derived from UNIX, the changes to the 
source were so substantial that it is now considered a system 
similar to UNIX, rather than a branch of it.
